## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves the development of a **custom assembly station** for the **Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW)**.  
It includes both the **design of a promotional giveaway** and the creation of a dedicated **robot-based assembly system** to mount it efficiently.

The system integrates a self-developed robotic arm and combines mechanical, electronic, and software components to form a complete, automated solution.

## 🎬 Demonstration Videos

Below are videos demonstrating the functionality of the assembly station:
